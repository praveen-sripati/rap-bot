# The Rap Bot (AI-Powered) 🚀

A retro-themed, AI-powered web application that answers your questions with witty, philosophical, or hilariously irrelevant rap quotes. Styled as a 90s computer terminal with a "Matrix" digital rain background, the Rap Bot provides a unique and fun user experience.

Created with Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Node.js, and the Google Gemini API.
